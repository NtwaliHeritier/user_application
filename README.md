# User Application

This is an app that allows users to create, update and share plots.

Built using:

- Elixir
- Phoenix
- Liveview

To run it locally:

- clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:NtwaliHeritier/user_application.git`
- Run `mix deps.get` and `mix deps.compile` to compile the dependencies.
- Update your database credentials in config/config.exs
- Run `mix ecto.create` to create your database
- Run `mix ecto.migrate` to migrate your database
- Run `mix phx.server` to start your server
- Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)
- Run `mix test` for tests.

## Nice to have

A feature like live updates can be implemented using Phoenix Pubsub
